# rextend 0.3.1

* Update package templates to work with Rust >= 1.70 (#285)

# rextendr 0.3.0

* Ilia Kosenkov is now the official maintainer.

* Josiah Parry is now a contributor.

* Support Rtools43 (#231).

* `rextendr` has migrated to the use of `cli` for raising errors and warnings.

* Developer note: new helper function `local_quiet_cli()` introduced in `R/utils.R` to simplify silencing cli output.
  
## New features

* A new function `rust_sitrep()` that prints out a short report on the currently installed Rust toolchain (#274).

* A new function `write_license_note()` to generate `LICENSE.note` file from `Cargo.toml` (#271).

* `extendr_fn_options` parameter of `rust_source()` controls what type of options are emitted to `#[extendr()]` attribute (#252).

* `use_dev_extendr` flag makes `rust_source()` family of functions compile code using development version of `extendr`.
Development configuration is stored as an option named `rextendr.extendr_dev_deps` (#251).

* `features` parameter of `rust_source()` now correctly enables features in `extendr-api` and references required crates.
`features` not available in release version of `extendr` raises a warning (#249).

* A `<pkg_name>-win.def` file containing DLL exports is created by `rextendr::use_extendr()`. It is used during linking phase on Windows and solves the problem of compiling very large projects, such as `polars` (#212)

* Support extendr macro with options (#128).

* `rust_source()` got `features` argument to specify Cargo features to activate
  (#140).

  e.g. `NOT_CRAN` (#135).
