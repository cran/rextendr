\description{
Create the scaffolding needed to add Rust extendr code to an R package. \code{use_extendr()}
adds a small Rust library with a single Rust function that returns the string
\code{"Hello world!"}. It also adds wrapper code so this Rust function can be called from
R with \code{hello_world()}.
}
\details{
To avoid possibly messing up your R package, \code{use_extendr()} will not do anything if
either a directory \code{src} or a file \code{R/extendr-wrappers.R} is already present in your
package source.
