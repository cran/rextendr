Regardless of which operating system you use, we recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install and maintain your Rust toolchain. 
On Linux and OS X, you simply run the following command in a shell:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
No further action should be needed.

On Windows, things are a little more involved. First download `rustupâ€‘init.exe` from the [rustup site](https://rustup.rs/) and run it, following the on-screen instructions. Rust may require installation of [VC++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (more instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup)).
Once installed, execute the following rustup commands:

```
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-gnu
```

Second, install Rtools. The latest installer is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). 
Alternatively, Rtools can be installed using chocolatey:
```
choco install rtools -y
```

Finally, make sure that environment variables are set up correctly.
`R_HOME` should point to the R folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.1.0` (be careful with spaces in the path).
`RTOOLS40_HOME` should point to the Rtools folder (usually set up automatically by the installer), which is `C:\rtools40` by default.
`PATH` should contain paths to `%R_HOME%\bin` and `%RTOOLS40_HOME%\usr\bin`, as well as cargo, which is found at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` if installed using `rustup-init.exe`.
